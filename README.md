# PriorityQueue

A generic priority queue abstract data type with multiple implementations, plus
a simple example driver program.

This software is for use of students on the module UG409765 Software
Construction at the University of the Highlands and Islands as the starting code
for Assignment 1. (Please don't create public clones containing solutions!)

Instructions for the assignment are on Blackboard.

Clone this repository to get started. When you are working, remember to commit
often. Your use of Git is one of the marking criteria. Submitting a single large
commit will not only attract zero marks for that component, but will also be
seen as suspicious from the point of view of plagiarism. Work steadily and
commit your changes frequently. Consider starting a branch for work on each of
the different tasks, and merging them back to the trunk once they are complete
and working.

Any changes to the source code will be reflected in this repository, so keep
track of it as you work.

If you have any questions, contact me via the Discussion Board (preferred) or by
email.
